# Photo-Organizer
Photo organizer tool to extract metadata from images, rename and sort the images.

This project came from an interest in sorting and extracting various information from photos since devices, e.g. phones, or even cloud services just name them as `IMG001.jpg` and call it a day.

## TODO
- [] Add sorting in designated output folder
- [] Add functionality to save metadata to CSV/JSON or database

## Note
Due to school and personal things, I have not had time (for a very long time) to work on this project.
There is still a lot on my TODO list.
For now, the project only works with JPEG photos as I only have had access to those.

I had high hopes when I began, and I hope to return and at least get it working for sorting my vacation pictures :-)
