## TODO

This project is still heavily under development since the underlying functionality is still missing (see below)

- [x] Extract image metadata (using `metadata-extractor-dotnet`)
- [x] Rename image
- [x] Add sorting in designated output folder structure
- [x] Setup main flow for organizing photos
- [x] Add functionality to save metadata to SQLite/SQL database
- [] Functionality for fetching/displaying information from the database
- [] Refactor the `Photo` naming - something ... better?
